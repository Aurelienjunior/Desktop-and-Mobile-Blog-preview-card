### What I learned

I'm excited to share the blog preview card I built through Frontend Mentor's challenge! It was a great learning experience, especially in mastering flexbox, shadows, and media queries.

Flexbox really flexed its muscles in this project! I used it to create the card's centered layout and to perfectly position the profile information section. It was so satisfying to see elements align effortlesslyâ€”flexbox is definitely my new best friend.

Adding a subtle drop shadow to the container was a game-changer. It instantly boosted the card's visual appeal, making it pop off the page. I'm definitely going to experiment more with shadows in future projects.

Media queries were essential for ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. I loved seeing the layout adapt gracefully as I resized the browser. It emphasized how crucial responsive design is for reaching a wider audience.

Overall, this challenge pushed my CSS skills to new heights. I'm eager to continue exploring these techniques and tackle even more complex designs in the future!
